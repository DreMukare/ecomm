The following instruction assume you are using VS CODE
- Clone the repo
- cd into the directory of just downloaded folder
- Open terminal and run `npm run install` this will install required node_modules
- Now open index.html in `/dist` folder and open the page with live-server (supposing you have live server plugin installed)

*p.s - It has webpack-server but some issue with sorting it out hence using live-server*
