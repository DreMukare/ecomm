The following instruction assume you are using VS CODE
- Clone the repo
- cd into the directory of just downloaded folder
- Open terminal and run `npm run install` this will install required node_modules
- Now open index.html in `/dist` folder and open the page with live-server (supposing you have live server plugin installed)

*p.s - It has webpack-server but some issue with sorting it out hence using live-server*

In this technical test, we would like to see a Restful API application with a frontend which will be 
interacting with the different API endpoints. We would like you to follow best coding practice to 
demonstrate your knowledge and skills.
Task Scenario:
Blinx are developing a new store which sell a range of items, including music and games.
The store will need:
ï‚· Some form of view which customers can see and search items 
ï‚· A simple customer login 
In addition, Blinx would like to see an overview page which contains graphics to show how many 
items have been bought on a certain day and the total revenue of the items. 
The overview and login data can be generated through JSON so there is no requirement for a 
backend and database. 
For this task we would like the following to be used: 
Frontend: 
- Vanilla JavaScript
- We recommend using some sort of module builder like Webpack (Would be good to see but 
not required)
- For graphs for the overview use (	https://www.highcharts.com/	)
- No frontend frameworks can be used in this technical test e.g. Vue, React - we would like to 
see how your core skills are.
When this task is complete, we would like you to create a git repo which will hold a ReadMe for the 
initial setup of the project, so that we can run the project.
